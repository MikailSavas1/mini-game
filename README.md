# mini-game
A boring mini-game, that is coded well-structured and based on JavaScript.

It can (also) be used as a solid structure for developing further, own mini-games. 

The game reminds of playing ping-pong on your own.

By controlling a dynamic-wall/board with the keyboard, you have to keep a moveable ball within the canvas.
